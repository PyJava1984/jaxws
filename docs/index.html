<p>${PRODUCT_NAME}&nbsp; is a Web Services framework
that provides tools and infrastructure to develop Web Services solutions for the 
end users and middleware developers.
</p>
<p>With ${PRODUCT_NAME}, clients and web services
have a big advantage: the platform independence of the Java programming 
language. </p>

</ul>
The documentation/samples included with JAX-WS that is distributed on Java.net describes how to use
JAX-WS to develop and deploy your webservices endpoints in a servlet container. 
The samples discussed in this document and available as part of JAX-WS 
distribution are tested to work on Glassfish and on Apache Tomcat. The 
deployment is demonstrated using JAX-WS RI specific proprietary deployment 
descriptor sun-jaxws.xml.&nbsp;
<p>If you
wish to use JAX-WS in a Java EE container in a portable manner (using JSR 109 
deployment descriptors), please refer to the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp">Java EE 6</a> or <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/">Glassfish</a>
documentation/samples. The majority of the documentation included with JAX-WS is
valid with Java EE 6 as well.</p>
