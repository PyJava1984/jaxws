<p>Web Service endpoints may choose to work at the XML message level by
implementing the <code>Provider</code> interface. The related
information about&nbsp;<code>Provider</code> endpoints is documented
in&nbsp;<a href="provider.html">provider</a> page. However&nbsp; <code>Provider
</code>endpoints are synchronous i.e. they receive XML requests and
they return XML responses synchronously in invoke() method. If the
endpoint wants to spawn a thread to process the request, it would block
the jax-ws runtime thread and has to manage all the low details
synchronizing the threads when the response is available. Also blocking
a thread doesn't really scale well especially when the underlying
transport is capable of handling asynchronous request and responses. RI
provides an implemention specific solution to this problem by
introducing&nbsp; <code>AsyncProvider. </code>This is similar to <code></code><code>Provider
</code>endpoints but the difference is that the endpoint
implementations have to implement <code>AsyncProvider </code>interface.</p>
<h2><code>AsyncProvider Example</code><code></code></h2>
<p>The following example shows an <code>AsyncProvider</code> example
that accesses the payload of the request.<br>
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
@WebServiceProvider 
public class AsyncProviderImpl implements AsyncProvider&lt;Source&gt; {     
    public void invoke(Source source, AsyncProviderCallback cbak, WebServiceContext ctxt) {...}
}</code></pre>
<h2><code>AsyncProvider</code> sample</h2>
See a&nbsp; <a href="../samples/asyncprovider">sample</a> that
illustrates <code></code><code>AsyncProvider </code>endpoints.<br>
