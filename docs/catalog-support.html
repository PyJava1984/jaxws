<h2>Catalog Support</h2>
<p>Often times, such as for performance reason or your application specific 
needs, you have a need where you want to resolve the WSDL/Schema documents 
resolved from the copy of it you have either bundled with your client or server 
or just to resolve it not from where a WSDL/schema imports points to but rather 
from where you want it to be picked up.</p>
<h3>A Sample catalog file</h3>
<h4>jax-ws-catalog.xml<code><br>
</h4>
<p>&lt;catalog xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog&quot;
prefer=&quot;<b>system</b>&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;<b>system</b> <b>systemId</b>=&quot;<a href="http://foo.org/hello?wsdl">http://foo.org/hello?wsdl</a>&quot;
<b>uri</b>=&quot;HelloService.wsdl&quot;/&gt;<br>
&lt;/catalog&gt;</p>
</code>
