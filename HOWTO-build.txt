How to build
===============
Use "ant" to build.

If using NetBeans 5.5.1, a project directory has been
created under jaxws-ri. (If you are using NetBeans 4.0, there is a 4.0
version of project.xml in the Documents and Files section of the
jax-ws-sources site.)

How to build distribution files (includes samples/docs/jars)
======================================================
Use "ant clean dist" to build and create the JAR files, samples and docs.

After creating the distribution files, if you wish to overlay the
JAX-WS RI implementation onto your Glassfish V2
or later application server:

1.)  Make sure you have an AS_HOME environment variable set to your
GlassFish root directory, i.e.:

export AS_HOME=/usr/local/glassfish

2.)  cd dist/jaxws-ri

3.)  run "ant install"
