/**
 * This object is set to {@link Packet#webServiceContextDelegate}
 * to serve {@link WebServiceContext} methods for a {@link Packet}.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the user application calls a method on {@link WebServiceContext},
 * the JAX-WS RI goes to the {@link Packet} that represents the request,
 * then check {@link Packet#webServiceContextDelegate}, and forwards
 * the method calls to {@link WebServiceContextDelegate}. 
 *
 * <p>
 * All the methods defined on this interface takes {@link Packet}
 * (whose {@link Packet#webServiceContextDelegate} points to
 * this object), so that a single stateless {@link WebServiceContextDelegate}
 * can be used to serve multiple concurrent {@link Packet}s,
 * if the implementation wishes to do so.
 *
 * <p>
 * (It is also allowed to create one instance of
 * {@link WebServiceContextDelegate} for each packet,
 * and thus effectively ignore the packet parameter.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Attaching this on a {@link Packet} allows {@link Pipe}s to
 * intercept and replace them, if they wish.
