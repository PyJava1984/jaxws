/**
 * Meta annotation for selecting instance resolver.
 *
 * <p>
 * When service class is annotated with an annotation that has
 * {@link InstanceResolverAnnotation} as meta annotation, the JAX-WS RI
 * runtime will use the instance resolver class specified on {@link #value()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link InstanceResolver} class must have the public constructor that
 * takes {@link Class}, which represents the type of the service.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link Stateful} for a real example. This annotation is only for
 * advanced users of the JAX-WS RI. 
 *
 * @since JAX-WS 2.1
