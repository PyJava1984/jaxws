/**
 * Receives incoming messages from a transport (such as HTTP, JMS, etc)
 * in a transport specific way, and delivers it to {@link WSEndpoint.PipeHead#process}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since this class mostly concerns itself with converting a
 * transport-specific message representation to a {@link Packet},
 * the name is the "adapter".
 *
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is twofolds:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * To hide the logic of converting a transport-specific connection
 * to a {@link Packet} and do the other way around.
 *
 * <li>
 * To manage thread-unsafe resources, such as {@link WSEndpoint.PipeHead},
 * {@link Codec}, and {@link Decoder}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Adapter}s are extended to work with each kind of transport,
 * and therefore {@link Adapter} class itself is not all that
 * useful by itself --- it merely provides a design template
 * that can be followed.
 *
 * <p>
 * For managing resources, an adapter uses an object called {@link Toolkit}
 * (think of it as a tray full of tools that a dentist uses ---
 * trays are identical, but each patient has to get one. You have
 * a pool of them and you assign it to a patient.)
 *
 * {@link Adapter.Toolkit} can be extended by derived classes.
 * That actual type is the {@code TK} type parameter this class takes.
