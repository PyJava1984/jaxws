<H2>1. WS-Addressing in JAX-WS 2.1</H2>
<P><a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/addr/">Web Services Addressing</a>
provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address Web services and messages.
JAX-WS 2.1 specification requires support for W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-core">Core</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-soap">SOAP Binding</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-wsdl">WSDL
Binding</a>. In addition to that, JAX-WS 2.1 RI also supports <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/">Member
Submission</a> version of WS-Addressing. This allows an application built using
standard JAX-WS 2.1 APIs to enable/disable W3C WS-Addressing on the client and
service endpoint. The member submission version is supported in an implementation
specific way. The subsequent sections describe how the two WS-Addressing
versions can be enabled/disabled on client and server side .</P>
<h3>1.1 WSDL Description</h3>
<P>W3C WS-Addressing WSDL Binding defines a new standard extensibility element, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ws-addr-wsdl-20060529/#uaee">wsaw:UsingAddressing</a>,
that can be used to indicate that an endpoint conforms to the WS-Addressing
specification. JAX-WS 2.1 RI generates this extension element in the WSDL if W3C
WS-Addressing is enabled on the server-side. On the client side, the RI
recognizes this extension element and enforce the rules defined by the W3C
specification.</P>
<P>There is no standard mechanism to describe Member Submission version support
in the WSDL.</P>
<h3>1.2 When is WS-A engaged ?</h3>
<P>W3C WS-Addressing SOAP Binding <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-soap-20060509/#conformance">defines</a>
that if a receiver processes a message containing a <code>wsa:Action</code>
header, then SOAP Binding is engaged, and the rules of the specification are
enforced. JAX-WS 2.1 RI follows same rule for Member Submission version as well.</P>
<P>In effect, irrespective of whether an endpoint advertises WS-Addressing in
the WSDL or not, if a client sends WS-A headers, including <code>wsa:Action,</code>
then the endpoint will enforce all the rules of the specification. For example,
if the value of <code>wsa:Action</code> header is not matching with the expected
value, then a fault with appropriate code and sub-code is thrown back to the
client.</P>
<H2>2. On the server side</H2>
<P>This section describes how W3C and Member Submission WS-Addressing can be
enabled/disabled on the server-side.</P>
<H3>2.1 Starting from Java</H3>
<P>This section describes how WS-Addressing can be enabled/disabled if you
develop an endpoint starting from a Java SEI.</P>
<P>By default, WS-Addressing is disabled on an endpoint starting from Java. If
that is the expected behavior, then nothing else needs to be done. In that case
any WS-Addressing headers received at the endpoint are ignored.</P>
<h4><b>2.1.1 Addressing annotations</b></h4>
<P>If WS-Addressing support needs to be enabled on an endpoint, then along with <code>javax.jws.WebService</code>
annotation, <code>javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing</code> annotation need to be
specified for enabling W3C WS-Addressing. If Member Submission WS-Addressing
needs to be enabled then&nbsp; <code>com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressing</code>
annotation needs to be specified on the service endpoint. For example, the
service endpoint in&nbsp; <code>fromjava-wsaddressing</code> sample looks like:</P>
<pre><b>@java.xml.ws.soap.Addressing</b>
@javax.jws.WebService
public class AddNumbersImpl {
...
}
</pre>
<P>To enable, Member Submission WS-Addressing, the SEI definition needs to be
changed to:</P>
<pre><b>@com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressing</b>
@javax.jws.WebService
public class AddNumbersImpl {
...
}</pre>
<P>Once WS-Addressing support is enabled on a service endpoint, then:</P>
<ul>
  <li>For W3C only, the standard <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code> extensibility
    element is generated in the corresponding <code>wsdl:binding</code> section.
    For Member Submission, there is no standard mechanism.</li>
  <li>All WS-Addressing headers are understood, i.e. if any WS-Addressing header
    is received with a <code>mustUnderstand=&quot;1&quot;</code>, then a
    mustUnderstand fault is not thrown back.</li>
  <li>All WS-Addressing headers received at the endpoint are checked for correct
    syntax, for example an error is returned back if <code>wsa:ReplyTo</code>
    header does not match the infoset defined in the corresponding
    specification.</li>
  <li>If any WS-Addressing header received at the endpoint is not of correct
    cardinality, then an error is returned back to the client.</li>
  <li>If <code>wsa:Action</code> header value does not match with that expected
    for that operation, then an error is returned back to the client.</li>
  <li>Any response message sent back to the client contains the required
    WS-Addressing headers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Annotation parameters</b></p>
<p>Both <code>javax.xml.ws.soap.Addressing</code> and <code>com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressing</code>
annotations take two optional Boolean parameters, <code>enabled</code> (default
true) and <code>required</code> (default false). If <code>required</code> is
specified true, then WS-Addressing rules are enforced. Otherwise the inbound
message is inspected to find out if WS-A is engaged and then the rules are
enforced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, for W3C only, <code>wsdl:required=&quot;true&quot;</code> is
generated on the extensibility element.</p>
<p>For example, to enforce Member Submission WS-Addressing rules on the server
side, the above code sample will change to:</p>
<pre>@com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmissionAddressing<b>(enabled=true, required=true)</b>
@javax.jws.WebService
public class AddNumbersImpl {
...
}</pre>
<h4>2.1.1 Implicit Action</h4>
<p>In most common cases, an implicit Action association, as defined by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ws-addr-wsdl-20060529/#defactionwsdl11">W3C
WS-Addressing WSDL Binding</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/#_Toc77464327">Member
Submission</a>, will be sufficient. For such cases, only using the correct
annotation to enable Addressing is required. The client looking at such a WSDL
will send the implicit <code>wsa:Action</code> header. If only Addressing is
enabled by using the appropriate annotation at the SEI,&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.1.1 Explicit Action</h4>
<p>This section describes how an explicit Action Message Addressing Property can
be associated with an operation in the SEI.</p>
<p>W3C WS-Addressing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ws-addr-wsdl-20060529/#actioninwsdl">WSDL
Binding</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/#_Toc77464325">Member
Submission WS-Addressing</a> define mechanisms to associate Action Message
Addressing Property with an operation. JAX-WS 2.1 defines <code>javax.xml.ws.Action</code>
and <code>javax.xml.ws.FaultAction</code> annotations to explicitly associate an
Action with <code>input</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>fault</code>
messages of the mapped WSDL operation. For example, one of the methods in the <code>fromjava-wsaddressing</code>
sample looks like:</p>
<pre>@Action(
  input = "http://example.com/input3",
  output = "http://example.com/output3",
  fault = {
    @FaultAction(className = AddNumbersException.class, value = &quot;http://example.com/fault3&quot;)
  })
public int addNumbers3(int number1, int number2) throws AddNumbersException {
...
}</pre>
<p>The generated WSDL fragment looks like:</p>
<pre>&lt;operation name="addNumbers3">
  &lt;input <b>wsaw:Action="http://example.com/input3"</b> message="tns:addNumbers3"/>
  &lt;output <b>wsaw:Action="http://example.com/output3"</b> message="tns:addNumbers3Response"/>
  &lt;fault message="tns:AddNumbersException" name="AddNumbersException" <b>wsaw:Action=&quot;http://example.com/fault3&quot;</b>/&gt;
&lt;/operation></pre>
<P>where <code>wsaw</code> is bound to W3C WSDL Binding namespace or Member
Submission namespace depending upon the annotation used to enable Addressing. </P>
<h3>2.2 Starting from WSDL</h3>
<P>This section describes how WS-Addressing can be enabled/disabled if you
develop an endpoint starting from a WSDL.</P>
<P>For W3C only, if the WSDL contains the standard extensibility element <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code>
then that is sufficient. The only way to enable Member Submission WS-Addressing
is to use the <code>com.sun.xml.ws.developer.MemberSubmission</code> annotation
described above. </P>
<P>The annotation in the SEI takes precedence over the standard extensibility
element in the WSDL.</P>
