<p>JAX-WS is an API for building web services and clients.  It is
the next generation Web Services API replacing JAX-RPC.<br>
</p>
<p>With JAX-WS, clients and web services have a big advantage: the
platform independence of the Java programming language. In addition,
JAX-WS is not restrictive: a JAX-WS client can access a web service
that is not running on the Java platform and vice-versa. This
flexibility is possible because JAX-WS uses technologies defined by the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C): HTTP, SOAP, and the Web Service
Description Language (WSDL). WSDL specifies an XML format for
describing a service as a set of endpoints operating on messages.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>This release includes the following documentation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ReleaseNotes.html">JAX-WS Release Notes</a></li>
  <li><a href="UsersGuide.html">User's Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="jaxws-tools.html">JAX-WS Tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="samples.html">JAX-WS Samples</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/spec-download.html">JAX-WS API Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
The documentation/samples included with JAX-WS that is distributed on Java.net describes how to use
JAX-WS to develop and deploy your webservices endpoints in a servlet container. 
The samples discussed in this document and available as part of JAXWS 
distribution are tested to work on Glassfish and on Apache Tomcat. The 
deployment is demonstrated using JAXWS RI specific proprietary deployment 
descriptor sun-jaxws.xml.&nbsp;
<p>If you
wish to use JAX-WS in a Java EE container in a portable manner you need to use the
standard Java EE 5 deployment descriptor; please refer to the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/index.jsp">Java EE 5</a> or <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">Glassfish</a>
documentation/samples.  The majority of the documentation included with JAX-WS is
valid with Java EE 5 as well. </p>
