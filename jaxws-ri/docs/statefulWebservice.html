<section title="Introduction">
	<p>
		${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} has a vendor extension that allows developers to bring back object state to the web service world. Normally, ${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} only creates one instance of a service class, and have it serve all incoming requests concurrently. This makes it essentially impossible to use instance fields of the service class for any meaningful purpose.
	</p><p>
		Because of this, people end up coding like C, in anti-OO fashion. Either that or you end up with writing boiler-plate code to dispatch a request to the right instance of your real domain object.
	</p><p>
		The stateful web service support in ${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} resolves this problem by having ${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} maintain multiple instances of a service. By using <a href="wsaddressing.html">WS-Addressing</a> behind the scene, it provides a standard-based on-the-wire protocol and easy-to-use programming model.
	</p>
</section>
<section title="Usage">
	<p>
		Application service implementation classes (or providers) who'd like to use the stateful web service support must declare <tt>@Stateful</tt> annotation on a class. It should also have a <b>public static</b> method/field that takes <tt>StatefulWebServiceManager</tt>.
	</p>
<pre>
@Stateful @WebService @Addressing
class BankAccount {
    protected final int id;
    private int balance;
    
    Account(int id) { this.id = id; }
    
    @WebMethod
    public synchronized void deposit(int amount) { balance+=amount; }

    // either via a public static field
    <font color=red>
    public static StatefulWebServiceManager&lt;BankAccount> manager;
    </font>
    // ... or  via a public static method (the method name could be anything)
    <font color=red>
    public static void setManager(StatefulWebServiceManager&lt;BankAccount> manager) {
       ...
    }
    </font>
}
</pre>

<p>
After your service is deployed but before you receive a first request,
the resource injection occurs on the field or the method.

<p>
A stateful web service class does not need to have a default constructor.
In fact, most of the time you want to define a constructor that takes
some arguments, so that each instance carries certain state (as illustrated
in the above example.)

<p>
Each instance of a stateful web service class is identified by an unique
EndpointReference. Your application creates an instance of
a class, then you'll have ${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} assign this unique EPR for the
instance as follows:

<pre>
@WebService
class Bank { // this is ordinary stateless service
    @WebMethod
    public synchronized W3CEndpointReference login(int accountId, int pin) {
        if(!checkPin(pin))
            throw new AuthenticationFailedException("invalid pin");
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount(accountId);
        return BankAccount.manager.export(acc);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Typically you then pass this EPR to remote systems. When they send
messages to this EPR, ${PRODUCT_SHORT_NAME} makes sure that the particular exported
instance associated with that EPR will receive a service invocation.

</section>
<section title="Things To Consider">
<p>
When you no longer need to tie an instance to the EPR,
use {@link #unexport(Object)} so that the object can be GC-ed
(or else you'll leak memory.) You may choose to do so explicitly,
or you can rely on the time out by using {@link #setTimeout(long, Callback)}.
 *
<p>
{@link StatefulWebServiceManager} is thread-safe. It can be safely
invoked from multiple threads concurrently.
