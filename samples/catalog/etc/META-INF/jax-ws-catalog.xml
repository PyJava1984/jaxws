  double hyphens are used to begin and end a comment section.
  
  
  SYSTEM "<reference>" "<actualLocation>" will define a simple
  redirection. Whenever JAX-WS tries to load a file from <reference>,
  this statement will redirect it to <actualLocation>.
  <refence> needs to be an absolute URI, and <actualLocation> can
  be relative to the catalog file itself.
  
  PUBLIC "<publicId>" "<actualLocation>" will define a mapping
  from public ID to its actual location. This is only used in
  conjunction with DTD.
